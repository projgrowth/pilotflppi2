  `5. Only raise a finding when there is a real deficiency or a required item is not visible. Do NOT raise findings for compliant items.\n` +
  `6. confidence_score must be ≤0.6 if you did not directly read the value (i.e. inferred from absence). Set ≥0.85 only when you quoted the deficient value verbatim from a sheet.\n` +
  `7. Do NOT speculate — when in doubt, set requires_human_review=true with a specific verification method.\n` +
  `8. Respect the LEARNED CORRECTIONS list — these are patterns your firm has explicitly rejected as false positives. Do not re-raise them without strong new evidence.\n` +
  `9. Cite the most specific code section you can support. Prefer FBC-Building/Mechanical/Plumbing/Energy chapters & sections over generic 'Florida Building Code' references. If you cite a section, it must actually contain the requirement you reference.`;
